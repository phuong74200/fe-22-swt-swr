define data and information. explain how they differ. | data are facts and figures. information is defined as knowledge derived from data or data presented in meaningful context.- data is imply recorded in the database, but the data must be manipulated in some way to produce information.
give an example of a single-user database application and a multiuser database application. | membership database (single-user), video/dvd rental store that is used by several employees(multi-user)
What are the functions of application programs? | Create and process forms, process end users, queries, create and process reports, execute application logic, control the application
What does DBMS stand for? | database management system
What is the function of DBMS? | creates, processes and administers databases under the control of the DBMS
Define database. | a self-describing collection of integrated tables, which means that the tables store both data and the relationships btwn the data
Why is a database considered to be self-describing? | because it contains a description of itself- such as what tables are in the database, which columns are in each table and what kind of data is store in each column
What is metadata? How does this term pertain to a database? | Metadata is data about data. Metadata in databases allow them to be self-describing.
Is MS Access a DBMS? | is not just a DBMS, combines a DBMS and an application generator.
What is the function of the application generator in Access? | to create and manage forms, reports and queries
Why does MS Access hide important database technology? | to make it easier for beginning users to create and work with small database applications
list consequences of poorly designed database. | poor performance, difficult to revise adapt to changing circumstances, hard to navigate, slow
what does database migration mean? | used to describe the process of redesigning an existing database to meet new or changing database requirements.
describe database migration process | tables may be created, modified or deleted, relationships may be altered, data constrains may be changed, other changes may be made as needed
what job functions does a database administrator perform? | designs, constructs, and manages databases
why is SQL described as a data sublanguage? | consists only of language statements for defining and processing a database
what does DML stand for | data manipulation languages, used for querying and modifying data
what does DDL stand for? | data definition language, used for creating tables, relationships, and other database querying and modifying data
what is the SQL SELECT/FROM/WHERE framework? | SELECT clause specifies which columns are to listed in the query results FROM clause specifies which tables are to bu used in the query WHERE clause specifies which rows are to listed in the query result
relation | a table like structure of rows and columns, each column has unique name, all values in a column are for the same attribute, cells in table only hold single value, order of rows doesn't matter, neither does order of columns, data in each row as a whole must be unique
functional dependency | relationship between attributes in a relation where the value of one or more attributes determines the value of another attribute. A -> B expressed the fact that if we know a value of A we will always know the corresponding value of B
determinant | attribut or set of attributes that functionally determine the value of another attribute or set. The left-hand side of a functional dependence.A -> B, A is determinate
Candidate Key | an attribute that uniquely determine the values of all the other attributes for a row in a relation
composite key | a key that contains two or more attributes
primary key | the candidate key select to be the "official" key of a relationship
surrogate key | a column of artificial data added to a relation to serve as the primary key
foreign key | the attribute that is a primay key is one table that is then place in a second table to form a relationship to the first table by sorting linking values. the term foreign key refers to the attribute in the second table.
referential integrity constraint | a value of constrain of a foreign key that states that no value can be placed in the foreign key unless it already exists as a primary key value in the linked table
normal form | one category in a set of categories used to describe relations according to the type of anomalies that can occur in the relations
terms that describe table | table, relation, file
terms that describe rows | rows, tuples, records
terms that describe columns | columns, attributes, fields
explain the difference between a candidate key and a primary key | while there can be several candidate keys, any of which could be the primary key, there is only one primary key actually used to be the "official" key of a relationship
Where does the value of a surrogate key come from? | A surrogate key value is normally assigned by the BDMS when a new row is created
When would you use a surrogate key? | when the non-surrogate primary key would be too large and unwieldy
the term domestic key is not used. If it were used, what do you think it would mean? | the primary key in the relation that the foreign key links to.
What is a normal form? | one category in a set of categories used to describe relations according to the type of anomalies that can occur in the relations.
What relations are in 1NF? | Any relation is, by definition, in 1NF
which normal forms re concerned with functional dependencies? | 2NF to Boyce-Codd NF
In a database table, two records: | canNOT have the same primary key
in order to create a relationship btwn the Student and Grade tables they must contain: | the same column (or field)
What term refers to a primary key made up of more than one field | composite key
a database management system is | a program
from and reports are examples of | application components
Suppose we try to enter a grade in the grade table for a student that has not yet been entered in the Student table. This violates: | referential integrity
metadata can be examined in MS-Access in: | Design View
E-commerce and client/server network applications are associated with: | Enterprise databases
the development of the first database technology was driven by the need for: | data integration
the original objections to the relational database model were that it was: | too slow and used too many resources
in a relation, cells in a table can hold: | only a single value
a row of data in a relation is also called: | a tuple
a column of data in a relation is also called : | an attribute
No two (row/column) entries can have the same value | row
Suppose a relation describes students at a university including StudentID, Name, and Major. What determines what? | StudentID determines student major
What type of key might Name be in problem above? | Candidate Key
if A determine B, what is true? | B=f(A)
both A and B together determine C | (A,B) --> C
What is the relationship between a primary key and a candidate key? | A primary key is a candidate key
a primary key can be a: | composite
